Hi, I’m Eng Teck. Fresh graduates from Monash University majoring in Data Science. I’m passionate on programming as well as financing. I specialise on machine learning and deep learning. I’m also willing to learn and constantly grow new skills.

Educations:

In these 3 years at Monash, it enabled me to do things I like and surrounded me with mindful people. My involvement in joining different clubs gave me a strong groups of friends linked by social events. The studies also acquire us with knowledge on algorithms and code architectures. Not only that, it gives opportunities for us to expose to AI (Artificial Intelligence) which encompasses in machine learning and deep learning knowledge.
